* Add email to contact details form.
* Define consistent terminology for reservee, interment/burial, 
* Fix issues with the back behaviour of role wizard.
  - Going to the review page, pressing back, selecting the same address, and selecting back again, causes nothing to happen.
    If back is then pressed again, jumps back to people page.
* Simplify breadcrumb into a list (<ul>) and use the CSS pseudo element :before to render the slashes in-between.
* Fix display of multibutton when option in drop down is significantly longer than the default option.
* In location drop-down's on allocation form, check for plot availability (status = available, unit associated with any places)
* Indicate which form fields are required.
* Add hooks to models for cleaning and formatting data, e.g. capitalizing names, lower casing gender, etc.
* Add validation rules to specs.

* Have Backbone validations go off to the server.
* Create standard JSON format for all requests,
    e.g. {success: <bool>, exception: <string>, form_errors: <hash>, ...}
    Rename form_errors to errors, make anything else reference 'response'.
* Add a universal error handler to the RoleWizard base view.
