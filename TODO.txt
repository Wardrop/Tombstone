* Fix issues with the back behaviour of the role wizard.
  - Going to the review page, pressing back, selecting the same address, and selecting back again, causes nothing to happen.
    If back is then pressed again, jumps back to people page.
* Simplify breadcrumb into a list (<ul>) and use the CSS pseudo element :before to render the slashes in-between.
* Fix display of multibutton when option in drop down is significantly longer than the default option.
* In location drop-down's on allocation form, check for plot availability (status = available, unit associated with any places), but still show plots which allow multiple interment.
  - Also, don't display parents with no available children.
* Indicate which form fields are required.
* Add hooks to models for cleaning and formatting data, e.g. capitalizing names, lower casing gender, etc.
* Add validation rules to specs.
* Make JavaScript templates dynamic so variable data such as drop-down's can be prepopulated correctly.
* jQuery DatePicker modifications to the form are not always updated in the model.
  - Same problem when a form is re-opened. The model is not updated with the formatted date.
  - American date format seems to be used.
* Receipt no/transactions (many to one) need to be provided.
* Add mailing contact to RoleWizard.
* Change reservee doesn't allow you to edit previously entered details. May need to make a new interface for changing a reservee.
* Limit the number of records returned over JSON.
* Add success flash message banner when reservation is submitted.
* Make multibutton fall back to normal input button when only one option is available.
    
Refactor Oppurtunities
----------------------
* Convert project to padrino
  - Convert controllers into namespaced controllers.
  - Use content_for.
* Add autoloading to models so class names in associations can be referenced by name rather than symbol.
