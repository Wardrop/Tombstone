* Role-Wizard
  - Fix issues with the back behaviour of the role wizard.
    + Going to the review page, pressing back, selecting the same address, and selecting back again, causes nothing to =
      happen.
      If back is then pressed again, jumps back to people page.
  - Add mailing contact to Role Wizard.
  - The change reservee function doesn't allow you to edit previously entered details. May need to make a new interface
    for changing a reservee.
  - Limit the number of records returned over JSON (no pagination; limit only)
* Simplify breadcrumb into a list (<ul>) and use the CSS pseudo element :before to render the slashes in-between.
* Indicate which form fields are required.
* Add hooks to models for cleaning and formatting data, e.g. capitalising names, lower casing gender, etc.
* Add validation rules to specs.
* Make JavaScript templates dynamic so variable data such as drop-down's can be prepopulated correctly.
  - Will need to use alternative delimiters for Backbone.js template parser.
* Compile validation errors into single lines (e.g. Reservation -> Person must have date of death)
* Plot's should be searchable objects on the find page. They should have their own view page.
  On such a view page, it would show associated records and photos.
* Add polyfills for IE8 compatibility: https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr/wiki/HTML5-Cross-browser-Polyfills
  - ECMAScript5 shim
* Test interface to make sure it works with missing allocation information, such as in the case of a partial save
  (may as well test missing place)
  Pages to test include: find, edit, view, delete, home
* Test behaviour of sessions with ID's that don't exist in the database. In other words, test the robustness.
* What should happen when a place being deleted has associated blob data (i.e. images)
* Should a place be allowed to be deleted if it has only 'deleted' allocations associated with it?
* If attempting to delete a place that has child places, what should be behaviour be considering the performance
  implications?
* Refactor delete operations to use the before_destroy hook to DRY-up delete operations with conditions or other tasks
  that need to be carried out, such as deleting associations.
* Type field for place form
  - Does a free-text field need to be provided for the "type" field for the place form?
  - List of types should be dynamic based on those already in the database.
* Add checkboxes to place results on search page for the sake of bulk deleting places.
