* Role-Wizard
  - Fix issues with the back behaviour of the role wizard.
    + Going to the review page, pressing back, selecting the same address, and selecting back again, causes nothing to happen.
      If back is then pressed again, jumps back to people page.
  - Add mailing contact to Role Wizard.
  - The change reservee function doesn't allow you to edit previously entered details. May need to make a new interface for changing a reservee.
  - Limit the number of records returned over JSON (no pagination; limit only)
* Simplify breadcrumb into a list (<ul>) and use the CSS pseudo element :before to render the slashes in-between.
* Multibutton
  - Fix display when option in drop down is significantly longer than the default option.
    Maybe change to apple-style drop-downs, and using overlay hidden to hide options above and below the current selection.
  - Fall back to normal input button when only one option is available.
* Indicate which form fields are required.
* Add hooks to models for cleaning and formatting data, e.g. capitalising names, lower casing gender, etc.
* Add validation rules to specs.
* Make JavaScript templates dynamic so variable data such as drop-down's can be prepopulated correctly.
  - Will need to use alternative delimiters for Backbone.js template parser.
* Compile validation errors into single lines (e.g. Reservation -> Person must have date of death)
* Ensure records are only marked as deleted.
  - Ensure plots assigned to deleted allocations are available.
* On the find page, make deleted and provisional records distinct.
* Add more searchable fields, e.g. plot, status
* Plot's should be searchable objects on the find page. They should have their own view page. =
  On such a view page, it would show associated records and photos.
* Add polyfills for IE8 compatibility: https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr/wiki/HTML5-Cross-browser-Polyfills
  - ECMAScript5 shim
