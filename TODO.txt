* Fix issues with the back behaviour of the role wizard.
  - Going to the review page, pressing back, selecting the same address, and selecting back again, causes nothing to happen.
    If back is then pressed again, jumps back to people page.
* Simplify breadcrumb into a list (<ul>) and use the CSS pseudo element :before to render the slashes in-between.
* Multibutton
  - Fix display when option in drop down is significantly longer than the default option.
  - Fall back to normal input button when only one option is available.
* In location drop-down's on allocation form, check for plot availability (status = available, unit associated with any places), but still show plots which allow multiple interment.
  - Also, don't display parents with no available children.
* Indicate which form fields are required.
* Add hooks to models for cleaning and formatting data, e.g. capitalising names, lower casing gender, etc.
* Add validation rules to specs.
* Make JavaScript templates dynamic so variable data such as drop-down's can be prepopulated correctly.
  - Will need to use alternative delimiters for Backbone.js template parser.
* Receipt no/transactions (many to one) need to be provided.
* Add mailing contact to RoleWizard.
* The change reservee function doesn't allow you to edit previously entered details. May need to make a new interface for changing a reservee.
* Limit the number of records returned over JSON.
  - Add pagination?
* Should the reservee/deceased be able to also act as the next of kin and/or applicant?
* Search
  - Add sorting interface on find page (when we do paging).
  - Add helper to interface for showing search options.
