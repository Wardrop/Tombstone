* Role-Wizard
  - Limit the number of records returned over JSON (no pagination; limit only)
* Indicate which form fields are required.
* Add hooks to models for cleaning and formatting data, e.g. capitalising names, lower casing gender, etc.
* Add validation rules to specs.
* Test interface to make sure it works with missing allocation information, such as in the case of a partial save
  (may as well test missing place)
  Pages to test include: find, edit, view, delete, home
* What should happen when a place being deleted has associated blob data (i.e. images)
* Should a place be allowed to be deleted if it has only 'deleted' allocations associated with it?
* If attempting to delete a place that has child places, what should be behaviour be considering the performance
  implications?
* Refactor delete operations to use the before_destroy hook to DRY-up delete operations with conditions or other tasks
  that need to be carried out, such as deleting associations.
* Type field for place form
  - Does a free-text field need to be provided for the "type" field for the place form?
  - List of types should be dynamic based on those already in the database.
* Add checkboxes to place results on search page for the sake of bulk deleting places.
